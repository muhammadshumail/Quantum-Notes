# Quantum-Notes
I have created these for personal reference. However, I do believe that many students of Quantum Technology will find it useful. Please do let me know if you find these useful or have any comment or feedback.

I am thankful to my Stanford Professors David Miller, Leonard Susskind, Jelena Vuckovic, and many others from whom I have learnt a lot about this. Besides, I am thankful to many others from whom I have learnt through there web pages and YouTube videos.
